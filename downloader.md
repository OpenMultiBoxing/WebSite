# Downloader

User/client side software maintaining addons updated

## Features
- Cross platform (golang?) or at least running on both Windows and Mac (linux would be nice too)

- Simple UI but also "all background" mode just keeping stuff up to date

- Scan/crawl all addons for OSS license and addition (maybe work with [Globe](https://www.townlong-yak.com/globe/) there too)

- (maybe?) Flags non OSS addons (maybe suggest replacements)

## Issues

- Where to stage/have the zips ?
  - forward to twitch cdn
  - get a cdn sponsor ?
  - use github release pages as cdn
