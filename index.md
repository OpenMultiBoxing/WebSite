# Wow Addons (Open Source)

Welcome to WoWAddons.org the hub for truly Open Source World of Warcraft Addons!

We just started this effort Mid August 2019! Hopefully will be ready in time for WoW Classic launch or sooon after!

One of the first few projects to tackle are the [packager](packager.md) and the [downloader](downloader.md)

We could also have a search like (or better integrated with) [Globe](https://www.townlong-yak.com/globe/) in order to see inline all the code done by fellow developers

Join the conversation through GitHub issues, PRs, or [Discord](https://discord.gg/t8msyQU)
