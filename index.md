# Wow Open Box (Open Source compliant Multiboxing)

Welcome to WowOpenBox.org the hub for truly Open Source and Blizzard rules compliant World of Warcraft MultiBoxing/Dual-Boxing!

We just started this effort Mid November 2020!

Join the conversation through GitHub, make or help prioritize [issues](https://github.com/WowOpenBox/WowOpenBox/issues/), PRs, or [Discord](https://discord.gg/SMGvEeb)

First functional [release](https://github.com/WowOpenBox/WowOpenBox/releases) was on November 22nd 2020!

Participate and let's make this the best tool for multiboxing (in addition to being the only Open Source one).

## Installation

WowOpenBox is optimized for Microsoft Windows 10.

We will eventually have an all in one installer but for now you need to get Tcl/Tk for windows with twapi first:
