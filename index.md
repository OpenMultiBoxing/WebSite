# OpenMultiBoxing (Open Source, safe, Multiboxing)

This is an extension of the project started for World of Warcraft multiboxing ([WowOpenBox](https://WowOpenBox.org/) but that applies to any kind of Windows game or app, including browser games (but still without input broadcasting/not breaking any rules).


See the [WowOpenBox installation](https://github.com/WowOpenBox/WoWOpenBox#installation) and instructions and check the "Capture foreground window" checkbox.

You can then use the (configurable) hotkey `Ctrl-Shift-C` to capture whichever window you want.
